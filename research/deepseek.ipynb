      "DeepSeek AI Insights: ### **Common Complaints & Issues**\n",
      "1. **Allergy & Sanitation Concerns**:  \n",
      "   - **Severe cross-contamination** leading to a hospital visit (tree nut allergy).  \n",
      "   - Employees **not changing gloves** after handling unsanitary surfaces or personal items (phone, magazine).  \n",
      "   - Food safety complaints (e.g., \"potentially spreading bleach,\" \"cream dispenser nozzles dirty\").  \n",
      "   - **Two reports of food poisoning**, raising hygiene red flags.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Unreasonably Slow Service**:  \n",
      "   - **Repeated long wait times** (20–45 minutes for simple orders like bagels/sandwiches).  \n",
      "   - Staff unresponsive to urgent time constraints (e.g., refusing to prioritize orders when customers needed to leave).  \n",
      "   - Inefficient handling of peak-hour crowds (\"35 minutes for a bagel is crazy\").  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Overpricing & Hidden Fees**:  \n",
      "   - **Excessive fees for substitutions** (e.g., $4 surcharge for allergen-free ingredients).  \n",
      "   - High base prices even for basic items (e.g., $13 for a bagel sandwich, $5.87 for a plain bagel with cream cheese).  \n",
      "   - **Misleading tip percentage options** (e.g., 15% of $31 incorrectly shown as $7.34).  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Inconsistent Food Quality**:  \n",
      "   - Bagels described as \"mid,\" \"stale,\" or \"no better than Wegmans.\"  \n",
      "   - Poorly prepared drinks (e.g., \"flat\" cappuccino, \"scalding\" coffee, under-toasted avocado toast).  \n",
      "   - Criticisms of pre-made, low-quality ingredients (e.g., \"cheap deli sandwiches with cute names\").  \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Staff Attitude & Training**:  \n",
      "   - Complaints of **rude or indifferent workers** (\"surly cashiers,\" ignoring customers at the register).  \n",
      "   - Confusion about substitutions/fees not communicated upfront.  \n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Operational Inefficiencies**:  \n",
      "   - **Glacial checkout process** with long lines and redundant steps (e.g., retyping emails for receipts).  \n",
      "   - Loud music outdoors detracting from ambiance.  \n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Recurring Positive Themes**  \n",
      "1. **Bagel & Menu Variety**:  \n",
      "   - Praise for \"best bagels in New York,\" diverse options (e.g., vegan, gluten-free, creative sandwiches).  \n",
      "   - Love for in-house baked goods (ciabatta, cookies) and beverages (cold brew, kombucha, mimosas).  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Atmosphere & Location**:  \n",
      "   - Outdoor seating with scenic views and \"immaculate vibes.\"  \n",
      "   - **Historic, quirky charm** as a college-town staple near Cornell University.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cultural Appeal**:  \n",
      "   - Hybrid café/bar concept (\"multi-purpose place\") with alcohol, board games, and community appeal.  \n",
      "   - Loyalty as a \"must-visit\" for tourists and students.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Friendly Staff (When Present)**:  \n",
      "   - Highlighted positive interactions with helpful, polite employees.  \n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Actionable Suggestions for Improvement**  \n",
      "1. **Food Safety & Allergy Protocols**:  \n",
      "   - **Mandate allergy training** and implement strict cross-contamination protocols (e.g., dedicated prep areas).  \n",
      "   - **Enforce glove/sanitation rules** (e.g., no phones while handling food, frequent glove changes).  \n",
      "   - Regularly clean equipment (e.g., cream dispensers) and audit hygiene standards.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Streamline Operations**:  \n",
      "   - **Hire additional staff** during peak hours to reduce wait times.  \n",
      "   - Offer **real-time wait estimates** via digital boards or signage to set expectations.  \n",
      "   - Simplify checkout (e.g., auto-fill customer email).  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Pricing Transparency**:  \n",
      "   - Remove hidden fees for substitutions, or **clearly disclose surcharges** before ordering.  \n",
      "   - Fix POS system tip calculations to reflect accurate percentages.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Staff Training & Morale**:  \n",
      "   - Invest in **customer service workshops** to improve consistency in staff friendliness.  \n",
      "   - Train baristas on coffee preparation standards (e.g., properly steamed milk).  \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Menu & Quality Control**:  \n",
      "   - **Audit ingredient freshness** (e.g., pre-made eggs, avocado toast) and cooking processes.  \n",
      "   - Consider **price adjustments** for simpler items (e.g., plain bagels).  \n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Enhance Ambiance**:  \n",
      "   - Reduce outdoor music volume for a more relaxed vibe.  \n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Summary**  \n",
      "**Strengths to Leverage**: The restaurant’s historic charm, bagel quality, and eclectic menu with allergy-friendly options are major draws. Capitalize on its cultural status as a Cornell staple.  \n",
      "**Critical Fixes**: Prioritize food safety, reduce wait times, and improve pricing transparency to retain loyalty amid competition.  \n",
      "**Opportunity**: Promote its unique café-bar model and outdoor seating while addressing operational pain points.\n"
